Commissioned by Mage Thagdal, Master of the Tower of Art  

Assignment: Seek out new troll species for breeding programs  
Location: Dwarven ruins in the Troll Mountains  

Preface: Trolls exhibit remarkable adaptability. On one hand, they interbreed with many other primitive races; on the other, they absorb traits from their surroundings. Both factors can give rise to new troll subtypes with entirely unique properties. This makes them ideal subjects for Zhentil Keep’s breeding programs.  

My task is to explore the ruins of an ancient dwarven fortress, known to the locals as the "Wailing Dwarf," in search of additional troll variants. The inhabitants whisper of dreadful new crossbreeds.  

The most promising specimens will be cataloged so that our strike team can capture them and integrate them into the monster-breeding facilities of Zhentil Keep.  

Discovered specimens so far:  

Ghost Troll – Contrary to what one might expect, this is not an undead troll. Rather, it is a crossbreed between an Invisible Stalker and a common troll.  

Spectral Troll – This appears to be a truly undead form of a troll—mayhap one that had contact with a wraith?  

Gray Troll – Another variety of troll corrupted by undeath. It seems that a complete level drain creates a Gray Troll.  

Phase Troll – This troll has been touched by the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to shift between planes like a phase spider. It can also create mirror images of itself, confounding attackers. A fascinating specimen, though difficult to control.  

Stone Troll – A breed of troll that, for some unknown reason, possesses the ability to harden its skin like solid rock. Extremely difficult to slay. Must be captured for breeding purposes!  

Black Troll – A highly dangerous type of troll. Black Trolls carry the blood of the Lower Planes within them. They can summon minor fiends, unleash powerful lightning spells, and shroud enemies in darkness.  

Faerzress Troll – These trolls have been exposed to a rare magical aura in the Underdark, known to the drow as "Faerzress", which grants them extraordinary properties. They are highly resistant to magic and can suppress it with their touch.  

Venom Troll – Trolls whose regenerative abilities have been severely exposed to potent toxins may, in rare cases, transform into Venom Trolls. The poisonous blood of this breed splashes onto nearby foes when struck, even onto the weapons that pierce it! Excellent for breeding, as they can be easily created. No need to capture one—experiments with common trolls and various toxins should suffice.  

Rumors also speak of a troll species from the East, one as large as a giant with two heads. However, as these creatures constantly seek to dominate other trolls, they are unsuitable for breeding.  

Additionally, Zhentil Keep has heard whispers of strange, ancient, and forgotten arcane magics slumbering within the fortress. Dwarves and magic? A peculiar thought. I shall investigate further.~

@21   = ~Ring of Acid Resistance, 'Zabarin’s Folly'  

During his conjurations of various oozes and slimes, the Sembian mage Zabarin relied on this ring to shield himself from the negative effects of his summoned creatures.  
His specialty was the summoning of miniature black puddings, which he sealed in prepared jars and discreetly placed in the pantries of his rivals.  
Zabarin met his rightful end beneath a massive avatar of Ghaunadaur, which he had attempted to control.  
Against the sheer power and malice of the Lord of Slime, even his beloved ring proved useless.

@60   = ~By the gods! Nothing keeps me in this place any longer. We thought that after that Amnian captain cleared the way, we could enter the ruins freely and loot to our hearts' content. We assumed the trolls were the worst of it—how wrong we were!  

It had all started so promisingly. We discovered a shaft that we hoped would lead us deeper into the fortress—without facing more trolls. Barkley was the first to descend and was bitten by a winged fiend. We managed to drive the creature away, but after we rested, Barkley’s head was suddenly torn from his shoulders! His ears sprouted wings, and he shrieked as he launched himself at me!  

By Beshaba, I ran as if stung by a phase spider. Now I just have to sneak back through the entrance hall and get out of here as fast as I can!~
@61   = ~Nhair’s Journal~
@62   = ~Day 2 of the Expedition  
We have arrived at the 'Wailing Dwarf', crossed the rickety suspension bridge, solved the puzzles, and now stand before this colossal statue. The wind howls through the stone. Only dwarves would think to carve such a monument straight from the mountain!  

Day 3 of the Expedition  
This whole venture is unsettling. Here we are, in the entrance hall of Korolnor, and I must say, it is eerily quiet. Too quiet for my liking. The others don't seem to mind, but a halfling knows when something is amiss. The hairs on my feet prickle with every step.  

Day 4 of the Expedition  
Captain Bryam, our fearless leader, marches ahead as if there's gold to be made at every corner. Lady Starthorn, the elf, is always so serious and contemplative—she studies every rune on the walls. Our mage, the Dogwizard, remains a mystery, constantly muttering to himself—I understand none of it. Then there’s Matron Iremar, our priestess, blessing everything and everyone with a calm that is almost unsettling. Stay alert, Nhair!  

Day 5 of the Expedition  
We've reached the great hall. The bronze plaques on the floor speak of this place’s long history. Everything is eerily empty. Not a single troll in sight! I don't trust this silence. No sound but our own echoes. It feels as if we are dancing on a thin sheet of ice over the Shaengarne River, and beneath us, the Wastrilith waits. I’ll keep my eyes open, especially at night. Who knows? This could all be a trap, and we’d be the fools walking blindly into it. I’ll watch the doors and the shadows. If something is lurking, I want to see it first.  

Day 6 of the Expedition  
Bryam and the others moved ahead to the second level. I stayed back to pry open one of these old dwarven chests when it happened—the portcullis behind me crashed down with a loud clatter. No way back! It was indeed an ambush. Now I must disarm the trap ahead and warn the others...~

However, the peculiar customs and quirks of the dwarves cannot be so easily imparted; those can only be learned through years of living alongside their famously gruff and stubborn kind.  

Dwarves cannot use this belt. A special enchantment also prevents the buckle from fastening around an elven waist.

@317 = ~With great enthusiasm, I joined Bryam Lancameth to explore the secrets of the ancient dwarven stronghold of the Kingdom of Korolnor.  

I have always been fascinated by the history of Shanatar, and I could not pass up the chance to see one of its old realms with my own eyes.  

Lancameth’s choice of companions may be surprising, but each is a capable adventurer—ready to face whatever evils stand in our way. I quickly befriended Lady Starthorn, the elven archer. The only one I find unsettling is the strange mage who calls himself the Dogwizard. He seems to be some kind of dwarf—mayhap a duergar? Either way, he has much experience in exploring dungeons. Could he be from the Underdark?  

Sadly, we lost our halfling thief, Nhair Ebendar. His body is beyond my reach, and thus, I cannot bring him back to life. Now only Lancameth, Starthorn, the Dogwizard, and I remain.  

At last, we have reached the old assembly hall, where, centuries ago, the envoys of Shanatar’s various kingdoms once gathered.  

I managed to decipher the symbols on either side of the corridor—each represents one of Shanatar's sub-kingdoms.  
Additionally, the names and titles of the kingdoms are recorded.  
Each kingdom was given a title reflecting its primary industry—for instance, Ultoksamrin, rich in Zardazil, was called the 'Zardazil Kingdom.' Only the greedy dwarves of Drakkalor received no mineral name for their city but were instead given the fitting title 'City of Greed.'  

The symbols are as follows:  

- Sondarr, the Seastar Kingdom – A coin, likely representing the god Vergadain  
- Holorarar, the Gold Kingdom – Moradin’s symbol, an anvil  
- Ultoksamrin, the Zardazil Kingdom – Dumathoin’s symbol, a mountain with a crystal  
- Barakuir, the Iron Kingdom – Laduguer’s symbol, a shield with an arrow  
- Torglor, the Silver Kingdom – An unknown symbol (a downward spiral?), unknown deity  
- Korolnor, the Jewel Kingdom – Seven gemstones, a symbol of an unidentified god—mayhap the old patron deity of this stronghold?  
- High Shanatar, the Glacier Kingdom – Thard Harr’s symbol, two gloves  
- Xothaerin, the Adamant Kingdom – Sharindlar’s symbol, a burning needle  
- Iltkazar, the Mithral Kingdom – Clangeddin’s symbol, two crossed axes  
- Drakkalor, the City of Avarice – Abbathor’s symbol, a jewel-encrusted dagger  

Beside each symbol is a small offering altar. It seems that the envoys of each kingdom once placed their ruling symbols here. The purpose of this ritual remains unknown to me.  

I will rest here briefly before continuing my research. I must be careful not to fall asleep, for strange noises echo from the surrounding halls, and I have not seen my remaining companions in some time. Where must they be wandering off to?~
@318 = ~Sea Ornament~
@319 = ~This is an intricately crafted piece of jewelry featuring coral and a central seastar. It must have been made in a place that, many centuries ago, was once a sea.~
@320 = ~Gold Nugget~
@321 = ~This is a massive lump of pure gold. Its value must be immense, yet something tells you that you shouldn’t sell it so easily.~
@322 = ~Zardazil~
@323 = ~Zardazil is a rare, amber-colored ore. Being a very soft metal, it is never used in its pure form but is instead alloyed or used to enamel other metals. It binds seamlessly with other materials, almost as if fusing with them.  

You have the feeling that this chunk of Zardazil was never meant for a smelting furnace. It is well-worn, as if it has passed through many hands over the centuries.~

The craftsmanship is exquisite, though the once-flawless edges have grown brittle over the centuries.  

Since you have seen similar stones throughout the stronghold, you are certain this gem was crafted here. You should not remove it carelessly before discovering its true purpose.  

It appears that this stone was frequently set into a socket or some kind of mechanism.~
@330 = ~Glacier Stone~
@331 = ~This smooth, rounded stone must have come from a glacier, its surface polished over the centuries by constant movement. It fits comfortably in your hand. How it found its way from the surface to the depths of this crumbling dwarven city remains a mystery.~
@332 = ~Adamant~
@333 = ~Adamant is a pure, jet-black metal ore. It is among the hardest, lightest, and most brittle of metals and is used to forge the legendary alloy known as adamantite.  

It is often utilized by the races of the Underdark, such as the drow, to craft weapons and armor.  

This chunk of adamant does not appear to have been meant for a smelting furnace. Its edges are worn, as if it has passed through many hands over the centuries.~
@334 = ~Mithral~
@335 = ~Mithral is a silvery-blue, lustrous metal mined from rare veins and deep deposits found throughout Faerûn and the depths of the Underdark.

A successful saving throw against death negates the poison’s effect.

The name 'Hellgate' does not refer to the Nine Hells but rather to the fallen city of Ascalhorn, now known only as Hellgate Keep. Countless wielders of arcane magic once dueled within its walls, summoning fiends from the Lower Planes, until the city was ultimately overrun by a great horde of Tanar'ri—demons of the Abyss.  

This staff, attributed to the enemies of the famed mage Wulgreth of Ascalhorn, grants its wielder the ability to summon such creatures.  

By wielding the staff, the user can briefly open a portal to the Abyss, allowing several lesser demons, known as Tanar'ri, to enter the Material Plane for a short time. Due to their chaotic nature, these demons may be difficult to control, though they will never attack their summoner. One can never be certain which fiend will answer the call—most often lesser Tanar'ri such as Manes, Rutterkin, or Dretches, and occasionally an Imp.  

However, there is a small chance that a greater Tanar'ri—a Nabassu—will emerge through the portal. The Nabassu cannot be controlled and will immediately attack any being in its vicinity that is not protected by a Protection from Evil spell.  

STATISTICS: 

Charge abilities:
– Once per day, summons a group of lesser Tanar'ri to serve the wielder for a brief time.

The berserkers were sent to aid their human allies on the surface and carried out their mission with distinction, quickly bringing the giants to the brink of defeat in a great battle. Unfortunately, the humans whom the dwarves had been sent to assist showed no desire to enter the fray themselves. One by one, after a long and grueling fight, the berserkers were overwhelmed and trampled by the giants.  

Rothdor’s axe passed through several hands before returning to the dwarves of Shanatar, but after the fall of the kingdoms of Xothaerin, Torglor, and Korolnor, the mighty weapon was lost and faded into obscurity.

Finding reliable companions for this venture was no easy task, but I believe I have now assembled a trustworthy party. Tomorrow, we set out for Eshpurta, where we will offer one final prayer to Tempus before advancing into the Troll Mountains from the south.

@2001 = ~Language and Script of the Dwarves 
by Aldym Ryscelsar of Halarahh, Halruaa. 

For outsiders and members of other races, the ways of the dwarves can often be difficult to comprehend. The dwarves themselves seem to have no interest in changing this, as they are rightfully known as one of the most reclusive and secretive humanoid races. 
For scholars who, for various reasons, must study their culture, this presents a significant challenge. Through my research, I aim to enable the reader to decipher the language and runes of the dwarven race, as well as to understand some of their peculiar customs.  

The dwarven language, Dethek, is written in an ancient runic script also called Dethek. 

As one might expect from dwarves, the script and sentence structure have remained largely unchanged for over five thousand years. Dethek runes are rarely written on paper or cloth, as such materials are short-lived and fragile. The runes are typically carved or etched into stone or metal—be it the walls of a building or the blade of a sword. Special forms of dwarven writing can be found in books made of bound metal plates or on stone tablets known as rune stones.  

Dwarven grammar is similar in structure to the Common tongue, likely due to the parallel development of both languages. 

This shared structure makes it relatively easy for speakers of Common to learn and translate Dwarvish. The Dethek runic alphabet consists of 24 characters. The sounds for "w," "x," and "z" are all represented by the same symbol. 
This may be confusing for humans attempting to translate the language, but for native Dethek speakers, it poses no issue, as very few words contain these letters.  

Clan and tribe names, as well as some of the most common words, races, or phrases, have their own symbols. These were useful for signage or the creation of rune stones. 

Each of the major races of Faerûn has been assigned a unique symbol. These symbols apply to both singular and plural forms, meaning the reader must infer the meaning from context. 

Other symbols serve as directional markers and signage, representing widely understood concepts: a foot indicating a safe path, an overturned helmet or drinking horn marking fresh water, and so forth.  

(A detailed list of dwarven rune symbols and the Dethek alphabet follows, which may prove useful should you ever need to decipher dwarven rune stones.)~  
@2002 = ~The History of the Shield Dwarves~  
@2003 = ~The History of the Shield Dwarves - Volume 1. 

A treatise by Oleus of Mintar, scholar in the service of Oghma.  

To us humans, dwarves are a difficult race to understand. They appear suspicious and grim. To comprehend why many of their seemingly peculiar traits have developed, we must examine the history of the dwarves along the Sword Coast. 

According to prevailing scholarly opinion, the Shield Dwarves, as we know them today, descend from a great dwarven kingdom known as Shanatar, founded by Taark Shanat, a dwarven hero of ancient times.  

Taark Shanat led his clan into what we now call the Lands of Intrigue. He settled in a vast cavern in the Underdark, founded the kingdom of Shanatar, and named his home Alatorin. His children set out and established their own kingdoms, stretching for miles beneath the earth. Together, they formed the dwarven empire of Deep Shanatar.  

At its height, Deep Shanatar consisted of nine sub-kingdoms alongside Alatorin: the kingdoms of Barakuir, Drakkalor, Iltkazar, Korolnor, Sondarr, Torglor, Ultoksamrin, Xothaerin in the Underdark, and High Shanatar on the surface. 

Each kingdom chose a patron deity from the dwarven pantheon, though some of these gods have long faded into obscurity.  

Additionally, each sub-kingdom was given a title reflecting its role within the dwarven dominion: 
Barakuir - the Iron Kingdom. 
Drakkalor - the City of Greed. 
Iltkazar - the Mithral Kingdom. 
Korolnor - the Jewel Kingdom. 
Sondarr - the Seastar Kingdom. 
Torglor - the Silver Kingdom. 
Ultoksamrin - the Zardazil Kingdom. 
Xothaerin - the Adamant Kingdom. 
High Shanatar - the Glacier Kingdom.  

The dwarves faced many enemies: drow, beholders, giants, and illithids. 

Particularly notable were Clan Duergar of Barakuir in their battles against the mindflayers and Clan Kuldelver, rulers of Korolnor, for their wars against the giants, which gave the neighboring Giant’s Run Mountains their name. 

But in time, the kingdoms turned against one another, and their once-unified realm collapsed.  

Weakened by constant infighting, the dwarves struggled to hold back the many foes that besieged them from all sides, encroaching upon the domains of Moradin’s children. 

Thus, the greatest of dwarven empires ultimately fell, and the survivors migrated northward to establish new realms. 

These were the ancestors of the race we now call Shield Dwarves. Yet, they never again achieved the splendor of old Shanatar.~

Moradin, The Soul Forger. 
Moradin, the All-Father, reigns supreme over the dwarven pantheon. He is the world’s forgemaster and the creator of the dwarves. His hammer blows shaped the first dwarven beings from the unyielding stone of the mountains. Under his watchful gaze, dwarves are trained in the arts of smithing, mining, and warfare.  

Berronar Truesilver, The Revered Mother. 
Berronar Truesilver, the Mother of the Dwarves, stands by Moradin’s side, sharing dominion over the dwarven pantheon. She is the protector of family, the keeper of hearth and home, and the patron of marriage. Under her blessing, dwarven families thrive, growing strong and united.

Clangeddin Silverbeard, the god of battle and honour in warfare, is the unyielding defender of his people. With his mighty twin axes in hand, he leads dwarven armies into battle against their foes. 
His name is called upon by dwarven warriors at the onset of battle, for under his protection, they know no fear.

Dumathoin, The Silent Keeper. 
Dumathoin, the Guardian of Secrets, watches over the tombs and treasures of the dwarves. Deep within the earth, he safeguards the lost knowledge of past ages and protects the riches forged by dwarven hands. His wisdom is boundless, and only those deemed worthy may benefit from his counsel.  

Forgotten Deities. 
In addition to the known gods of the dwarven pantheon, there were once other, lesser-known deities worshiped by certain dwarven clans. Though forgotten today, these gods played an important role in dwarven history and deserve further study.  

Old tales speak of Moradin’s twin children, who were cast out of the dwarven pantheon by their own father due to an unknown betrayal. The dwarven clans that once followed them were especially cursed, for they were forced at great speed—at least by dwarven standards—to choose a new patron deity.~

Day 101:  
Today is a glorious day, a day of destiny, for I have realized the truth! I, Dokuriingor, am the last descendant of the great dwarven clan of Karlyn Kuldelver! It is my fate to reclaim my lost kingdom of Korolnor! The voices whisper of immeasurable wealth and power, rightfully ours, should we seize the halls of our ancestors once more. The call of my forebears is strong in my ears, and I shall follow it, ready to overcome the challenges and trials that lie ahead.  

Day 103:  
The depths of our ancient kingdom call to me, luring me with their hidden treasures and lost secrets. I can feel the presence of the great Diinkarazan, the forsaken son of Moradin, imprisoned in the Abyss yet mightier than ever before. His voice whispers promises of unimaginable riches, of treasures surpassing our wildest dreams. I shall follow him, I shall fulfill his will, and I shall restore Korolnor by freeing him!  

Day 121:  
I have almost reached Diinkarazan’s prison. I stand before the gates of his dark throne, deep within the winding caverns of the Wailing Dwarf. He promises me endless riches, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to claim them. The power I feel coursing through my hands is intoxicating, and I shall wield it to rebuild Korolnor and reclaim our place in the world. The time of the Derro clan of Korolnor has come, and nothing will stand in my way!  

Day 127:  
The doors to the sealed throne room remain closed, and my hopes of opening them alone begin to wane. The ancient dwarves imbued their locks with a cunning that even surpasses my own. The seals are strong, decreeing that no dwarf of Korolnor shall ever again be able to unbar the doors to the old throne room. Not even a Derro, descendant of the great Shanatar! Not even I. What now?  

Day 130:  
But then, a spark of revelation! The ancient texts I have so meticulously studied reveal an unexpected truth. The sealed door that separates me from Diinkarazan’s throne cannot be opened by any descendant of Korolnor. But perhaps it *can* be opened by those outside Korolnor’s bloodline. I cannot unseal the doors—but perhaps others can! I must find a fool, someone I can lure here, someone who will open the doors for me.  

Day 233:  
I have devised a plan, a plan that will use the lesser races to achieve my goal. I shall lure the human adventurer Bryam Lancameth into the depths of this fortress, under the pretense of a joint expedition, and unwittingly make him open the doors that are locked to me. No one suspects that the feeble Dog Wizard they see before them is, in truth, a powerful Derro Savant!  

Day 281:  
The preparations are complete, and the trap is set. Soon, Lancameth and his companions shall descend into the abyssal depths, led by my cunning, guided by my deception. They will never realize that they hold the keys to my success in their hands, and I shall ensure that they unlock the gates that stand between me and my destiny. Diinkarazan waits, and I shall not disappoint him!  

Day 342:  
The expedition has reached the corridors of our fortress. The hours pass, and my impatience grows with every fading heartbeat. The fools still call me Dog Wizard. They will all die screaming.  

Day 345:  
My plan appears to be working. One by one, Bryam Lancameth’s companions have fallen. Now, only he and I remain before the sealed doors, and I can see the suspicion in his eyes, the flicker of mistrust taking root in his heart. But I shall not yield—not now, not when the goal is so close. He searches for a way to open the door. All I must do is wait.  

Day 351:  
Damnation! Bryam Lancameth has seen through my deception, has sensed the treachery in my heart and uncovered the truth behind my lies. Without a word of farewell, he stepped through the longed-for doorway, sealing it behind him and leaving me alone once more—left to linger in the void before the throne room! Madness claws at my thoughts as I scramble for a new way to open the doors. Diinkarazan waits, growing impatient… I must enter, enter, enter!~

After a brutal battle, the Verbeeg thrust his spear into the dragon’s maw, breaking off one of its massive fangs. The giant then had the tooth embedded into his spear, where it absorbed the dragon’s corrosive magic. Thus, Blackbite was born—a weapon still revered as a trophy of strength among the Verbeeg.

@2040 = ~The Giant Pantheon~  
@2041 = ~A Treatise on the Giant Pantheon  
Written by Azmor Delduin, Scholar of Arcane Myths and Ancient Religions  

Within the vast tapestry of mythological traditions woven throughout the realms of mortals, the pantheon of the giants stands as one of the oldest and most imposing. The grandeur and might of these ancient peoples, who once ruled the lands, are reflected in the diversity and power of their deities. These gods embody not only elemental forces and the raw power of nature but also the complex and brutal societal structures of the giants.  

At the center of the pantheon stands Annam All-Father, the creator god of the giants, also known as the Father of All Titans. He is the ruler of the divine realm, the Ordning, from which his children, the various races of giants, originate. Yet, according to legend, Annam withdrew from his progeny, disappointed by their endless conflicts, leaving them to divide the world among themselves.  

The Sons of Annam: Thrym, Surtr, and Stronmaeus  

The most renowned children of Annam are the First among Giants: Thrym, god of the frost giants, ruler of chaos and cold; Surtr, god of the fire giants, master of flame and destruction; and Stronmaeus, god of the storm giants, known for his wisdom and benevolence, yet as temperamental as the tempests he commands. These three embody the greatest realms of giantkind: Ice, Fire, and Storm.  

While these gods compete for dominance over their respective domains, they share a common belief in the unquestioned supremacy of giants over mortals. In their legends, they wage endless battles against one another, each striving to prove themselves as the true heir of Annam. Their followers live in perpetual anticipation that one day, their chosen god will claim ultimate control over all giants.  

Vaprak the Destroyer: An Outcast in the Ordning  

Among the giants, there exists a loathsome figure, neither of noble Annamite descent nor blessed by the elder gods: Vaprak the Destroyer, god of ogres and trolls. Vaprak, a brutal and untamed entity, embodies raw savagery and an insatiable hunger for destruction. His followers—ogres and trolls—stand in stark contrast to the more structured and honor-bound giants.  

Vaprak is described as greedy and ruinous, a god who lurks in the shadows, sowing chaos wherever he can. Some scholars believe that Vaprak once sought to be inducted into the pantheon of the giants, only to be cast out by Annam himself. His violent nature makes him feared among both gods and mortals, for he seeks to consume all that stands before him.  

Karontor: The Outcast Among Outcasts  

An even darker chapter in the pantheon of giants is the legend of Karontor, the deformed god of the cursed, worshiped primarily by fomorians and the forsaken. Once a beautiful and mighty giant, Karontor was twisted by envy and hatred, his heart as black as his ruined flesh. His crippled form is a reflection of his inner bitterness and his loathing for his kin.  

Karontor is regarded as the patron of outcast giants, those who do not belong among the great elemental titans. He is venerated in the deepest shadows of the world, especially by those who cling to the hope of revenge and a return to power. Ancient legends tell that Karontor was once equal to the other gods but was corrupted by his jealousy of Surtr and Thrym. In his madness, he defied the order Annam had established and was ultimately cursed, never to regain the greatness he once had.  

Among the dark myths that surround both Vaprak and Karontor, there are hints of a twisted alliance between these two gods. Both are outcasts in the divine order, delighting in destruction and chaos. It is said that Karontor once summoned Vaprak to conspire against the other giants. Yet, like all wicked beings, their partnership is fraught with mistrust. Each seeks to surpass the other and claim the loyalty of the forsaken for themselves.  

The Philosophy of the Pantheon  

The pantheon of the giants mirrors the societal structures of the titans themselves. It represents hierarchy, the rule of the strong, and the ceaseless struggles for power and dominion. Annam himself stands for the lost ideal of a united world of giants, but in his absence, the forces of chaos and hatred have crept into the Ordning. Thrym, Surtr, and Stronmaeus battle for their father’s legacy, while creatures like Vaprak and Karontor gnaw at the edges, waiting to disrupt the balance.  

This pantheon is a living, dynamic web of power struggles and personal vendettas, driving the giants into an endless cycle of war, conquest, and destruction. Just like the giants themselves, their gods embody the eternal conflict between power, order, and chaos—a struggle that will never end.~

@2057 = ~Bryam Lancameth’s Journal

We began our journey into the Wailing Dwarf hoping to uncover the secrets of the ancient dwarven fortress and put an end to the trolls. The ruins are filled with a strange wailing sound that echoes through the wind-swept halls. Is this wail, as I suspected, merely a clever mechanical trick crafted by the old dwarven builders? Or is it truly a curse, as the old legends claim?

Day 5
Dok, the Dogwizard, who joined us as a guide, seems to know a great deal about dwarven structures, which has been of great use to us.

Day 7
The deeper we go, the stranger this place becomes. We walk through abandoned halls and hidden pathways, yet encounter no monsters.

Day 8
Damn it! Our halfling thief, Nhair Ebendar, is dead. And the portcullis we passed has been dropped by an unknown hand. There is no way back.

Day 9
I've started watching Dok in secret. He whispers often when he thinks no one is listening. The deeper we go, the more pleased he seems. Is he speaking to the shadows? The air here is thick with old treachery. I must remain vigilant.

Day 10
The Dogwizard knows paths and secrets about the Wailing Dwarf that he has been keeping from us. I fear his intentions may be darker than we realize.

Day 11
Iremar is dead! How could this have happened? Just as we solved the dwarven puzzle in the assembly hall.

Day 12
Dok and I now stand before the great door said to lead to the Throne of the Mad God. I saw the Dogwizard mutter something – a prayer or a curse? I can wait no longer. I have decided to seal the door forever. I cannot allow the madness that lurks behind it to be unleashed. And that is exactly what the Dogwizard wants.

Day 13
The door is sealed! Dok, the Derro, and their mad god must remain trapped.

Day 14
I have been bitten by a Vargouille. I know what this means... I will die here, and my head will live on as one of those grotesque creatures from the Abyss. I must fight against it!

My time is running out. The bite is taking effect, and soon I will become one of them. I write these final words in the hope that someone more capable than I will find this record and learn from my mistakes. My only hope now is that these words are discovered before it is too late.~

@2059 = ~The History of the Shield Dwarves - Volume 2  

A treatise by Oleus of Mintar, scholar in the service of Oghma.  

Beyond the well-known race of Shield Dwarves, scholars have identified several other dwarven subraces, many of whom are even less welcoming to outsiders. It may surprise the reader to learn that these races, too, are believed to descend from the dwarven clans of Shanatar.  

Among them are the Duergar, also known as Gray Dwarves. According to consistent reports, the Duergar trace their lineage back to a clan of the same name, which once made its home in Barakuir, the Iron Kingdom. For reasons unknown, the clan turned against its kin, vanished for a time, and eventually returned—transformed into a cruel and twisted version of their former selves.  

Lesser known is that another ill-tempered denizen of the Underdark also descends from dwarves: the Derro. These small, long-haired creatures are prone to excessive cruelty and madness. They revere the former outcast twins of Moradin—Diirinka and Diinkarazan. Worshippers of Diirinka are far more numerous, perhaps because his twin brother, Diinkarazan, was banished to the Abyss.  

Before his expulsion from the dwarven pantheon, Diirinka was venerated by the dwarves of the subkingdom of Torglor, while Diinkarazan was worshipped by the dwarves of Korolnor. It stands to reason that over the centuries, some of the ancient dwarven clans of these two subkingdoms gradually became the Derro as we know them today, continuing their veneration of their cruel and maddened gods—the forsaken children of Moradin.~

The choice of a short sword for such a weapon may seem surprising, but in narrow tunnels and caverns, the shorter blade allows for a far more effective cutting technique than the longer, more cumbersome bastard- or longsword.

The history of this weapon is closely tied to Diinkarazan, the outcast dwarven god. Diinkarazan was banished into the Abyss by Ilsensine, god of the mindflayers. There, the outcast, long since driven mad by the horrors of the plane, has been brooding over revenge for centuries. All of Diinkarazan's hatred for mindflayers seems to be woven into this blade. In the hands of a skilled fighter, this sword becomes the nightmare of any illithid.

It is believed that the illithids go to great lengths to erase all memories of this weapon from the collective consciousness as quickly as possible.

@2075 = ~How Moradin Forged the Dwarves

In the deepest halls beneath the earth, where only darkness and the ancient whispers of stone reign, Moradin the All-Father kindled his divine forge. From the rock itself, hardened by the fire of his furnace, he forged the first dwarves. With each hammer blow, he shaped their bodies from iron, silver, and granite, and their souls from the unyielding will of the earth. At last, he breathed life into them. Thus, the children of Moradin awakened, strong as stone, steadfast as the mountains, ready to fulfill their destiny.

Moradin sent his dwarves forth from the bowels of the earth, where the world's molten core burns eternally. There, in the darkness, lurked not only mystery but also danger. Ancient evils and eternal night sought to halt their ascent. But the dwarves, imbued with Moradin's power, carved their way through the stone, fighting side by side, hammer in one hand, shield in the other.

After endless days and nights beneath the earth, as the rock grew lighter and the air thinner, the first dwarf broke through the final layer of stone and stepped into the light of the world.

For the first time, the dwarves beheld the sky—an endless vault that filled them with both awe and wonder. But what filled their hearts with the greatest joy was the sight of the mountains rising before them, majestic and proud, as if they had been created just for them. They immediately understood that this was the land Moradin had destined for them—the place where they would build their fortresses and settle their kin.

Before they set foot into the mountains, Moradin appeared one last time. "You have passed the trials of the deep", he spoke in a voice like thunder. "Now the realm of the mountains is yours. But never forget where you came from—from the heart of the earth, from the fire of my forge."

With these words, he blessed them, and the dwarves built their fortresses deep within the rock. They built with the wisdom and strength Moradin had granted them, and their cities flourished. The dwarves had risen from the depths and become the guardians of the mountains—and their history is etched into the stone halls for all eternity, the legacy of Moradin.

So the ancestors tell, and so it is passed down in the great halls. The dwarven people shall never forget where they came from.~

Since the oldest dwarven texts, carved onto stone tablets deep within the halls of their ancestors, not only Moradin the All-Father has been praised, but also Berronar, his wife and the Keeper of the Hearth. It is said that without Berronar’s wisdom and care, even the mightiest dwarf would be weak and lost, for she is the one who keeps the fire of loyalty and protection burning in the hearts of all dwarves.

When Moradin forged the first dwarves from stone and touched their hearts with the essence of the earth, it was Berronar who bestowed upon them their most precious gift: The bond of community. She wove invisible threads between the dwarves, stronger than any metal. These threads were spun from loyalty, honor, and protection, binding the dwarves not only to each other but also to the traditions and wisdom of their ancestors. Berronar was the guardian of these bonds, and her symbol is two eternal rings that never break.

Berronar taught them how to protect their halls and guard their families. She showed them how to tend the hearth fire, which not only brought warmth but also security. In every dwarven home, the Sacred Hearthfire burns—a fire lit by Berronar herself to protect the souls and dwellings of the dwarves.

But Berronar’s greatest act took place when the dwarves first faced the danger of being torn apart. In the early days, when the First Ones conquered the mountains and began carving their halls, envy and discord crept among them. The dwarves, quarreling over the precious ores and treasures of the earth, began to drift apart. A rift threatened to shake the very foundation of dwarven society.

Then Berronar descended from the celestial halls and stood between the warring clans. Her voice rang like the chime of an ancient, deep bell, and the earth trembled as she spoke: “You, children of Moradin, are all hewn from the same stone. Your bond is eternal and stronger than any vein of ore you might claim. Forget not what makes you strong—your unity, your loyalty, your honor. He who forsakes this is poorer than one who has no gold at all.”

With these words, she placed a silver ring upon the ground, the symbol of the eternal bond that can never be broken. She knelt and breathed a spark of the Sacred Flame into the ring, which immediately ignited, burning in the hearts of all dwarves. The quarreling clans fell to their knees, overcome with deep shame, and swore to never again break their loyalty to one another.

Since that day, Berronar has been revered as the goddess of loyalty, protection, and kinship. Dwarves wear silver rings as a sign of their bond to one another and to the traditions that Berronar gifted them. Every time a fire is lit in a dwarven hall, a silent prayer is whispered to Berronar, asking her to keep the flames of community burning and to strengthen the bonds between the dwarves.

And so Berronar, the wife of Moradin, remains the eternal guardian of dwarven unity, Keeper of the Sacred Flame, and in the hearts of the dwarves, her gift endures—the bond of loyalty, which neither time nor axe can sever.~

@2079 = ~Five Things a Dwarf Needs to Live

By Bardain Goldmug 
Excerpt from the work "The Wisdom of Stone: Tenets and Teachings for a Dwarven Life"

1. Solid Stone Beneath His Feet

No dwarf is whole unless he feels the solid rock beneath him, whether deep in the mines, the shaft, or the halls of his home. Stone carries us as it carries mountains—unyielding and silent. A dwarf without stone beneath his feet is like a hammer without a handle—out of place and useless. Beware those who spend their days on soft ground that wobbles and shifts like a trembling young deep rothé. Rock alone is our home, and being close to the earth is the true nature of a dwarf.

2. A Hammer That Always Speaks the Truth

A dwarf without a hammer is no dwarf, but a rock without an ore vein. The hammer—be it the forge hammer or the war hammer—is the tool that reflects our very soul. It splits the stone and reveals what lies hidden, whether that be a vein of mithral or the skull of an orc. A hammer in hand is more than a tool; it is the will of our people and a symbol of our strength. Beware the dwarf who walks without a hammer, for his path is wayward, and his goals are unclear.

3. The Loyalty of the Clan

No dwarf stands alone. No matter how deep a tunnel may reach, the dwarf always has his brothers and sisters of the clan by his side. The loyalty of the clan is like a web of steel—unbreakable and firm. It binds us and holds us upright, even when the stone crumbles. Without a clan, a dwarf is like a river without a source—lost and unable to find its purpose. The loyalty of our kin is the eternal bond that does not break, and every dwarf knows that the clan is his shield and his home.

4. The Wisdom of Moradin

Every dwarf may take pride in carrying the wisdom of Father Moradin in his heart. For Moradin forged us from stone and breathed into us the knowledge of earth and fire. This wisdom teaches us what strengthens the heart and clears the mind. He who forgets Moradin’s teachings is like ore without purity—useless and weak, crumbling under the first pressure. Beware, dwarf, of straying from the path of the All-Father, for only in his wisdom do we find true strength and the love of stone.

5. A Tankard of Good Ale

No mortal being knows the depths of a dwarf’s heart, but every child of Moradin knows that a tankard of good ale is like a mirror to our soul. A beer that is strong, bitter, and heavy warms us and gives us strength, just as the stone does. But beware of those strange brews favored by the weaker races—such light drinks make the heart feeble. A beer that does not have the color of the earth is not fit for a dwarf, and that is something every dwarf should know.

In summary: A dwarf may lose everything—gold, weapons, even the roof over his head—but without these five things, he is worth less than a hollow stone.~
@2080 = ~Ancient Dwarven Book~
@2081 = ~On Magic: A Warning

It is well known that we dwarves are a people of stone and earth, not of wind or whispered words. Our strength lies in hammer and chisel, in the forge and the mine shaft, not in the fleeting constructs of magic. The events that once took place beneath this mountain stand as a grim testament to our incompatibility with the world of sorcery.

Countless ages ago, our patron, driven by ambition and a fateful curiosity, turned to the arts of magic. His pursuit of power led him to the farthest reaches of the planes, where no torchlight could ever shine. Without respect for the ancient laws, he became lost in his magical cravings, and the result, as we all know, was catastrophe.

Through his actions, the deep foundations of our realm were shaken. Magic, wild and untamed, unleashed a calamity that nearly spelled the end of our great halls. Stone cracked, and screaming monsters flew through our ranks. It is clear that the souls of dwarves were never meant for the unpredictability of magic, just as rock was never meant to soar through the sky.

Thus, we dwarves have stood firm ever since, believing that magic is a source of unrest and misfortune for our people. We shun the arcane arts and instead place our trust in the strength of our hands, the sharpness of our axes, and the bounty of our mines. Our power lies in metal and stone, not in the fleeting promises of wizards.

May those who read this book honor the wisdom of our ancestors and respect the boundaries that protect us. The world of magic is a realm of change and uncertainty, and we, the people of stone, must uphold our legacy as guardians of the earth. 

May the fate of the Outcast of the Morndinsamman serve as both a testament to past mistakes and a warning to future generations.~
@2082 = ~The History of Korolnor~
@2083 = ~In the depths of time, beneath the untouched peak of Mount Batyr in the Troll Mountains, we founded the kingdom of Korolnor. Under the wise rule of Karlyn Kuldelver, the First of His Name, we carved our halls from living rock and brought glory and honor to the mountains.

But that glory faded when Diinkarazan, our patron, followed the path of magic. His heart, once pure and firmly rooted in the teachings of Moradin, was corrupted as he sought forbidden sorcery and delved into secrets that should have remained beyond the reach of all dwarves.

When his betrayal became apparent, Diinkarazan was cast out of Moradin’s pantheon. We sealed the gates to his sacred halls. His temple, once a place of prayer and reverence, was locked away, and his name was erased from our chronicles—so that never again would his dark, uncontrollable magic bring ruin upon us.

We sought refuge in the faith of Clangeddin, Father of Battle, and swore never to stray from the path of our ancestors. Here we stand, watchful and resolute, preserving our history and defending the peace our forebears once dreamed of.

Diinkarazan, the Banished One, always sought a way back into the throne room and the world of mortals. Korolnor’s duty was to stand watch over this mountain, ensuring that the lost son of Moradin could never again bring calamity upon the dwarven people.

But there were those among us who refused to abandon the path of Diinkarazan’s wild magic. Despite the corruption that had taken hold of our former patron, they remained devoted to him, driven by a thirst for power and blind faith. They attempted to free him and, in doing so, unleashed beasts from the Abyss that descended upon us in swarms. Their bite carried the Outcast’s curse, and our beloved clan brothers transformed into Diinkarazan’s winged servants.

When the betrayal was revealed, the elders of Korolnor decreed that those who would not renounce Diinkarazan could no longer remain among us. They were cast out as exiles, banished to the depths of the Underdark, into the realm of eternal darkness. Karlyn himself spoke a mighty rune-curse: No dwarf of Korolnor would ever again be able to open the door to the throne of the Mad God. Karlyn was the guardian, and he would fulfill this duty for all eternity, even beyond death.

May the descendants learn to recognize good and shun evil, and may the mistakes of the Banished Ones teach them always to seek the true path.~

@2084 = ~Derro Note~
@2085 = ~Troll Breeding Program~
@2086 = ~This note is written in a strangely altered form of dwarven script that you cannot decipher easily.~
@2087 = ~This text is written in Derro script, which appears to be a variant of dwarven writing. It is a record of the Derro savants' efforts to establish a troll breeding program:

Troll Breeding Program:
5 Gray Trolls received from the vampire
Fire and Ice Trolls recruited
4 Faerzress Trolls arrived from the Underdark

Further Plans:
Create 20 Spectral Trolls through contact with a wraith
Create 20 Stone Trolls using a basilisk’s gaze
Create 30 Ghost Trolls by crossbreeding with an invisible stalker
Create 30 Venom Trolls through contact with wyvern poison

All normal trolls are sent to the surface to hunt for human slaves, whom our master requires to open the sealed gates.
Once the gates are open and our god is freed, we will complete the troll army. Then, the plan to conquer the Underdark will be set into motion.~
@2088 = ~Ursummnogh’s Note~
@2089 = ~My loyal servant Ursummnogh,

Soon, a group of adventurers will enter the ruins we require for our purposes.
You are to hide with all your trolls until every member of the group has passed through the gate. Then, you must close the gate. Remember, you can only reopen the gate if you forge a new key! So do not seal it too early. The adventurers must believe this part of the ruins is uninhabited.

The adventuring party consists of the following members:
A human soldier named Bryam Lancameth
A halfling thief named Nhair Ebendar
An elven archer who calls herself Maid Starthorn
A human priestess known as Iremar
And a wizard of unknown race.

The group is extremely powerful and will destroy any of your trolls if they are discovered.

One of these members will attempt to free our god from the depths. He will reveal himself to you once all of the group has passed.~

Wild Mages, known for their ability to wield chaotic magic, gain greater benefits when using this item, though even they cannot fully control its wild nature. The spells "Chaos Shield" and "Improved Chaos Shield" protect against the negative effects of the mantle. However, even for a Wild Mage, the Armor Class and Saving Throw bonuses remain unpredictable, fluctuating between 0 and -5 each round.

In addition to offering strong protection against attacks, it allows the wearer to see through solid stone once per day as though it were glass. This magical ability is activated by the ancient dwarven runes, granting insight into hidden caves, mine shafts, and other underground secrets. Originally designed to help mine wardens locate hidden ore veins and ensure tunnel safety, the Mountain Warden is an invaluable tool for those who seek to uncover the mysteries of the Underdark.

STATISTICS:

@2104 = ~This is the severed hand of a troll.~
@2105 = ~This hand once belonged to the troll Grubnuk before he gifted it to you out of gratitude. The severed hand serves as a surprisingly effective weapon. When equipped, the tendons of the troll’s hand fuse with the wielder’s own, allowing it to be wielded like a claw, dealing piercing damage. While slower than smaller weapons, its greater damage output more than compensates for this drawback. A fragment of a troll's regenerative power transfers to the wielder. However, the hand saps a portion of <PRO_HISHER> life force in return, and it cannot be easily removed.

To achieve his goal, he bound the essence of an ancient being, known as Yllatharn the Thinker, into the diadem. Yllatharn was an incredibly intelligent yet utterly insane entity, overwhelmed by the flood of infinite thoughts and possibilities in the Astral Plane.

With Yllatharn’s guidance, the ruler created this intricately designed artifact, shaped like a small crown. The blue gemstone embedded within it seems to pulse faintly in the light. The item emanates an eerie aura—a feeling of deep insight coupled with a burdensome weight. Whoever wears it constantly hears a soft whisper, granting brilliant revelations yet sowing doubts and inner conflicts.

As a result, the wearer’s confidence and ability to react swiftly to situations suffer.

When its rune is activated, the hammer releases a powerful gust, refreshing a 30-foot area with clean air—sufficient to sustain eight humans (or twelve dwarves) under moderate exertion.

The head of this weapon is a metal stein, its sturdy handle repurposed as a deadly bludgeon. This ceremonial mace was frequently used in sacred rituals to douse gathered worshippers in ale, a blessing in the name of the Brewmaster’s divine revelry. To this day, the mace drips a steady trickle of beer from its upper rim. After prolonged exposure, either a struck opponent or even the wielder may find themselves intoxicated. Engraved into the shaft is an ancient dwarven saying: "If you can't outfight 'em, outdrink 'em!" 

The mace is considered a divine blend of dwarven craftsmanship and utter irresponsibility.

Now, once per day, the bearer of the pouch may reach inside and retrieve a glimmering gemstone. However, the magic is fickle—on occasion, instead of treasure, an irate beetle emerges, eager to make its displeasure known. The creature immediately bites the user’s hand before scuttling off to attack any creature within reach.
