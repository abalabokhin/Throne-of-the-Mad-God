@4200 = ~So, ye think ye’ll rest with my ancestors like that Lancameth fella?~
@4201 = ~What do you mean by that?~
@4202 = ~Leave me be.~
@4203 = ~Look at me! I’m a dwarf! Ye think I don’t know the history of my own kin? Ye could’ve asked me first if ye were lookin’ for the Wailing Dwarf.~
@4204 = ~You know of the structure that Bryam Lancameth visited?~
@4205 = ~Leave me alone.~
@4206 = ~Are ye jokin’? ‘Course I know it! *Every* dwarf in Amn knows Karlyn Kuldelver’s fortress. Well, almost every dwarf. The stronghold of my ancestors is one of the grandest works my people ever built! Do I know "the structure"—pfft...~
@4207 = ~Alright, listen up. If ye want to hear about this place, I’ll tell ye. Normally, that’d cost ye a fair pile of gold—but for ye, I’ll do it almost for free. Give me five hundred gold coins, and I’ll tell ye everythin’ there is to know about my kin’s fortress!~
@4208 = ~Five hundred gold is "almost for free" to you?~
@4209 = ~Alright, here’s the 500 gold coins. Tell me what you know about this place.~
@4210 = ~I don’t have that much gold. I’ll be back when I do.~
@4211 = ~Forget it.~
@4212 = ~If it helps ye stay alive longer, it’s well worth the coin! And no one’s forcin’ ye. So, what’s it gonna be? Five hundred gold for an old dwarf’s wisdom, or are ye wastin’ my time?~
@4213 = ~Alright, here’s the five hundred gold. Tell me what you know about this place.~
@4214 = ~Ye think I got all day to stand around waitin’ for ye? The dead ain’t buryin’ themselves.~
@4215 = ~...~
@4216 = ~Alright, fine. Just a bit of information. Otherwise, ye’ll end up on my cart later, and that’ll be even more work for me! I’ll tell ye what I know.~
@4217 = ~Now hand over the coin! Is it really five hundred? Let me count... ten, eighty... two hundred...~
@4218 = ~Typical dwarf.~
@4219 = ~A dwarf’s greed knows no rest.~
@4220 = ~Five hundred! Now, what were ye askin’ again? Ah, right. Listen well, <PRO_RACE>. Maybe my words will help ye survive this better than that fool Lancameth...~
@4221 = ~The structure folks now call the "Wailing Dwarf" once stood guard over the entrance to the ancient dwarven fortress of Korolnor. Its gateway is marked by a stone colossus in the shape of a dwarf—taller than the highest tower in Athkatla! The old dwarves carved the statue so that the wind howls and whistles through its massive mouth, like a storm giant’s song.~
@4222 = ~Most who come sniffin’ ‘round get weak in the knees just hearin’ the place, long ‘fore they even set eyes on it. Bah! A damn shame it’s now crawlin’ with trolls and all manner o’ filth.~
@4223 = ~Heh, maybe it ain't so bad that ye’re takin’ up this task. Ye don’t look quite as seasoned or well-equipped as Lancameth and his lot, but I see the fire of adventure in yer eyes.~
@4224 = ~Well, there ye have it. That’s all ye need to know before steppin’ into those ruins. Wish I could go with ye, but these old hands are fit for diggin’ graves, not swingin’ axes at monsters like in the old days.~
@4225 = ~Aye then, best I get back to me work. Got a whole cart full o’ corpses to haul from the Bridge District and put in the ground! Good luck on yer journey—may Dumathoin guide yer path and bless yer grave when ye meet yer end in his ancient halls.~
@4226 = ~Go on then, makes me job easier if ye lot go and get yerselves killed in that old ruin!~

@4227 = ~Have you found anything about my husband?~
@4228 = ~No, not yet.~
@4229 = ~I have your husband's head with me.~
@4230 = ~I have good news: You will be able to look into your husband's eyes again!~
@4231 = ~By Sune! What are you saying? How can this be? Does this tale truly find a happy ending after all this sorrow?~
@4232 = ~Not quite. Look, I have your husband's head with me.~
@4233 = ~Oh no! How dare you toy with my emotions like this!~
@4234 = ~His... head? That means he is... You... you really found him? And... and... he is...~
@4235 = ~It... it really is my husband! And he looks as if he has peacefully fallen asleep! So it is certain now. He is dead!~
@4236 = ~Oh, my heart feels as if it might break from sorrow! And yet, at the same time, I feel a deep relief that... *sob*... let me take a moment to breathe.~
@4237 = ~Forgive me. Even though this news should not surprise me, it still pains me greatly. I have composed myself.~
@4238 = ~What happened to him? How did he die?~
@4239 = ~He had turned into a creature of the Abyss. I had to strike him down to free him from that curse.~
@4240 = ~Bryam became a monster, but in his final moments, he found strength in his love for you, and thus Helm granted him peace.~
@4241 = ~He had turned into a monster. He tried to kill me, but I got him first!~
@4242 = ~That’s not really important now.~
@4243 = ~Believe me, you’d rather not know.~
@4244 = ~Thank you for being so honest about my husband’s fate, even though the thought of his suffering wounds me deeply.~
@4245 = ~I will see to it that my husband receives a proper burial. I have nothing to offer that could truly repay your deed. But rest assured, I will keep you in my prayers until the end of my days!~
@4246 = ~Farewell, Darcia.~
@4247 = ~It was an honor.~
@4248 = ~It’s fine.~
@4249 = ~Prayers won’t fill an empty stomach, but so be it.~
@4250 = ~Farewell! May Kelemvor be merciful to your soul when your time comes.~
@4251 = ~So it is certain now. He is truly dead? Even though this news should not surprise me, it still pains me deeply.~
@4252 = ~Aah! THAT is supposed to be my dear husband's head? Never! What madness compels you to present me with such a... such an abomination after all these years of longing and sorrow?~
@4253 = ~He had turned into a Vargouille.~
@4254 = ~I don’t care what lies you try to tell me! This is not the man I remember!~
@4255 = ~Clearly, Kelemvor has grown weary of me. There is no sense in clinging to lost memories. And certainly not in believing the monstrosities of arrogant adventurers! Begone, you are not worth my time. I will have to find another place to mourn.~

@4256 = ~I shall include you in my prayers to Kelemvor. If you have anything to report, you know where to find me.~  
@4257 = ~Please, do not disturb me in this sacred place, stranger!~  
@4258 = ~Can you not leave me be? Can you not see that I am grieving?~  
@4259 = ~Forgive me for intruding, but I have some questions about your husband.~  
@4260 = ~Grieving won’t bring your husband back—but maybe I can.~  
@4261 = ~Just a few questions about your husband, then I’ll be on my way.~  
@4262 = ~Fine, I’ll leave you be.~  
@4263 = ~My husband has been dead for years. Why else would I be mourning in this graveyard?~  
@4264 = ~I am searching for the place where your husband may have gone missing.~  
@4265 = ~At Kelemvor’s statue? Not at his grave?~  
@4266 = ~You seem to have been standing here for an eternity.~  
@4267 = ~The... place? Why?~  
@4268 = ~For many reasons. For you, it may mean finding closure about your husband’s fate.~  
@4269 = ~That is my concern.~  
@4270 = ~Do you want my help or not?~  
@4271 = ~*sobs* Do you know how terrible it is to live for countless years in uncertainty, never knowing what truly happened? Even now, I am consumed by the thought that he might one day return, though deep in my heart, I know the gods were not kind to him.~  
@4272 = ~Can you imagine my suffering? Not only do I have no remains to grieve over, but I must also live with the fear that his body is desecrated in some dark cave, devoured by ghouls...~  
@4273 = ~I am truly sorry for your loss.~  
@4274 = ~Ghouls—perhaps carrion crawlers, otyughs—there are many things out there that would relish the taste of your husband...~  
@4275 = ~That is why I stand here, at Kelemvor’s statue, praying to the Lord of the Dead, hoping he will show mercy upon my husband’s soul!~  
@4276 = ~I have given up all hope of ever holding my beloved in my arms again, but I still long for the day when I may lay a wreath upon his grave.~  
@4277 = ~Who knows? Perhaps we can ensure you’ll need only flowers, and no grave at all.~  
@4278 = ~I could look for clues about your husband during my travels, if that is what you wish.~  
@4279 = ~Do not give up hope. Let us seek him out and bring you certainty.~  
@4280 = ~I’m searching for dwarven treasures in the Troll Mountains anyway. If I find your husband, I’ll bring him back.~  
@4281 = ~Oh, how I wish for that, yes! And yet, I also fear the moment of dreadful certainty that he is truly gone.~  
@4282 = ~But you could finally move on with your life before it, too, slips away.~  
@4283 = ~Either way—standing here forever may not be the best way to spend it.~  
@4284 = ~Better a tragic end than an endless tragedy.~  
@4285 = ~One way or another—life goes on, with or without you.~  
@4286 = ~You... you speak so casually of such things. But there is truth in your words.~  
@4287 = ~Very well, if you wish to place yourself in the same danger as my beloved husband, that is your choice. I have nothing to offer as a reward. But if I can help you find that place, I shall—if it means taking even the smallest step forward in my life.~  
@4288 = ~One of the few things I have left of my love is his journal, in which he recorded his research on the dreadful place you seek. I have carried his belongings with me every day since his disappearance, for his handwriting and the words he left for me have been my only solace.~  
@4289 = ~I will give you his notes if you swear to keep an eye out for him and to return with what you learn.~  
@4290 = ~I swear, I will search for your husband!~  
@4291 = ~I promise, though I cannot guarantee I will find any trace of him.~  
@4292 = ~Very well. We shall search for him and keep you informed.~  
@4293 = ~You’ll learn soon enough what became of him.~  
@4294 = ~I’m quite good at making promises—keeping them, not that much.~  
@4295 = ~If you find anything that belonged to my husband, I beg you to return it to me... even if it is... his... his remains.~  
@4296 = ~I swear it, upon my honor!~  
@4297 = ~Of course. I will do my best.~  
@4298 = ~We’ll see if that can be arranged.~  
@4299 = ~I will return every single piece of your husband that I can find.~  
@4300 = ~My husband never should have undertaken that journey. And his choice of companions did not inspire much confidence! That... halfling thief, Nhair, from Athkatla—and then that little mage, whom people mockingly called the ‘Dog wizard’... Be careful not to share their fate!~  
@4301 = ~That’s a good tip. Thank you.~  
@4302 = ~I’ve done well enough so far.~  
@4303 = ~I am strong, smart, and swift. Nothing will happen to me!~  
@4304 = ~Can you tell me more about the companions who traveled with your husband?~  
@4305 = ~I don’t know much. As I said, that halfling thief, Nhair Ebendar, was a known troublemaker in this city. ‘We need a halfling to deal with the traps!’ my husband said when I voiced my concerns. Fortunately, he was accompanied by an older scholar of Oghma from Eshpurta, a priestess named Iremar. She seemed wise—especially compared to that little mage I mentioned.~  
@4306 = ~What troubled you about this mage?~  
@4307 = ~That is all I wanted to know. Now, where can I find the place Lancameth traveled to?~  
@4308 = ~Very well. Give me the documents, and I will begin my search.~  
@4309 = ~Here are his notes. I have not read much of them, but I believe they will at least tell you where he set off to.~  
@4310 = ~Good luck. I will keep you in my prayers to the good gods.~  
@4311 = ~Please do.~  
@4312 = ~What troubled me about him? Everything! I told my husband from the start not to take him along. Here in Amn, we have learned never to trust mages.~  
@4313 = ~That is, unfortunately, a common sentiment in this nation.~  
@4314 = ~Not surprising. For centuries, people here have regarded magic-users with great suspicion.~  
@4315 = ~A justified wariness, considering this land’s history and the havoc that mages have wrought upon it.~  
@4316 = ~Why would Lancameth bring along someone who wasn’t trustworthy?~  
@4317 = ~Did anything else about this mage stand out to you?~  
@4318 = ~My husband said that this mage, called the Dog Wizard, had already visited the site and was needed as a guide. That’s why he took him along.~  
@4319 = ~Where do I find the place Lancameth traveled to?~
