@6200 = ~By Berronar’s beard, ye be lugging around Mithril plates!~
@6201 = ~Aye, those be the plates of the legendary Karlyn Kuldelver, Giant-Slayer, Hero of Korolnor! I could forge ‘em into a fine suit o’ Mithril armor – harder than adamant and lighter than a Calishite nightgown.~
@6202 = ~But it’ll cost ye – ten thousand gold pieces, to be exact. So, what say ye? Want me to smith ye a Mithril suit o’ armor?~
@6203 = ~Aye, but ye don’t have all three pieces. Come back when ye’ve got the whole set, and I’ll hammer ye out a fine Mithril harness. Let’s move on…~
@6204 = ~Suit yerself.~
