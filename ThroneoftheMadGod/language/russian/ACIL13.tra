@4850 = ~Stand in reverence and listen to the history of this place, seeker of knowledge.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4851 = ~Praise be to Korolnor, the glorious Jewel Kingdom, built by Karlyn Kuldelver, descendant of the legendary Taark Shanat, who once laid the foundations of our great Shanatar. In the gleaming halls of Korolnor, treasures shimmered like the stars in the firmament, and our ancestors thrived under the protection of the mighty mountains and the deep reaches of our tunnels.~
@4852 = ~Karlyn Kuldelver, a valiant son of the dwarven people, embraced the legacy of his forefathers with a proud heart and skilled hands. Under his leadership, Korolnor flourished into a radiant jewel in the crown of kingdoms, a symbol of power and prosperity.~
@4853 = ~Yet Korolnor’s protection did not rest solely on the glimmer of its gems, for its people recognized the importance of divine favor. And so, Korolnor chose one of Moradin’s twin children as its patron deity. In the halls of faith, his name was praised, and his blessings poured over our kingdom like a sacred current.~
@4854 = ~Now you know a little more about the history of Korolnor. May this knowledge serve you well on your journey.~
@4855 = ~Over the centuries, the face of our once-revered patron deity changed. He transformed from a benevolent protector into a selfish being. His divine heart was corrupted by the greed for forbidden magic and the dark secrets hidden in the depths. Thus, Moradin’s child began to stain the honor of the Morndinsamman and stray from the paths of the dwarven ancestors.~
@4856 = ~The children of Korolnor knew nothing of the darkness that had entered their patron’s heart and continued to revere him with deep devotion, despite the signs that evil had crept into the halls.~
@4857 = ~Go forth and carry this as a warning: The light of truth and the strength of faith must always be nurtured to keep the shadows at bay.~
@4858 = ~In the darkest chapter of our history, buried deep in the gloom of the past, Moradin’s twin sons ventured into the shadowed domain of Ilsensine, the god of the mind flayers. Unaware of the lurking dangers and blinded by arrogance, they trod forbidden paths never meant for mortal eyes.~
@4859 = ~Fate had already woven its threads, and its judgment fell heavily upon Korolnor’s unwary patron. Betrayed by his own twin brother, he was condemned by the god of the mind flayers and cast into the endless depths of the Abyss.~
@4860 = ~There, in the pitch-black chasms of the Abyss, he was inflicted with a terrible punishment: The curse of eternal madness, which shattered his mind and trapped his soul in ceaseless torment, consumed by relentless vengeance and rage.~
@4861 = ~May you, seeker of wisdom, learn from the mistakes of the past and never lose humility before forces beyond your comprehension. Keep a clear mind and a pure heart, lest you follow the same dark paths.~
@4862 = ~In an act of boundless wrath and bitter disappointment, the mighty Moradin banished his own twin children from the halls of the dwarven gods, exiling them for eternity, so that such unspeakable calamity would never again befall the dwarven people. The horrors of their forbidden journey and the tragedy of their fate echoed like a dark refrain through the ages, and their names were stricken from the sacred texts, their memory fading like the dying light of dusk.~
@4863 = ~Korolnor, once a proud Jewel Kingdom, was forced to forge a new path—one illuminated by different stars. Under the harsh gaze of fate and the relentless tide of change, the people of Korolnor chose Clangeddin Silverbeard, the Unyielding, as the new protector of their halls and tunnels. But the wrath of their former patron knew no bounds, and from the depths of the Abyss, he swore vengeance.~
@4864 = ~His temple, once a place of prayer and reverence, became a symbol of madness, its stone gates sealed forever. The old throne room, once a seat of power and glory, became a silent witness to the evil that had fallen upon the once-magnificent kingdom. In the depths of its halls, the laments of the past still echo, while the curse of the Outcast hangs over the land like a dark veil that never fades.~
@4865 = ~Hold the tales of Korolnor in your heart, as a reminder that no fury lasts forever and that every change opens new paths to glory.~
@4866 = ~Once, this was the path of knowledge, a sacred road walked with reverence by the wise and learned of the dwarves. But now, intruders have crossed the threshold of our beloved realm, awakening the ancient defenses that have lain dormant for centuries. Where once the hope of enlightenment and wisdom flourished, there now lies the darkness of invasion and threat.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4867 = ~In days past, brave aspirants walked these halls, their hearts filled with courage and ambition, ready to face the trials of Korolnor’s sacred chambers and earn their place. But now, the paths are sealed, the gates shut tight, and the once-revered roads of knowledge are veiled in shadows and secrets, inaccessible to mortals and guarded by grim power.~
@4868 = ~Only those who claim to be scholars of Korolnor may enter the home of Clan Kuldelver. Despite the trials that now haunt these halls, are you prepared to face the tests?~
@4869 = ~What must I do?~
@4870 = ~I am ready to face the trials.~
@4871 = ~I’m not sure.~
@4872 = ~Read the inscriptions carefully and answer the questions of my brothers at the end.~
@4873 = ~What awaits me in these corridors?~
@4874 = ~How am I supposed to decipher your script?~
@4875 = ~Stories. Questions. And the dead intruders who perished in the traps and now haunt this place as spirits.~
@4876 = ~How am I to understand your writing and language?~
@4877 = ~A friend of the dwarves can also read their script.~
@4878 = ~What lies beyond the sealed door?~
@4879 = ~Then step forward, visitor of Korolnor, read the inscriptions, and answer the questions of my brothers.~
@4880 = ~Though you have not answered all questions correctly, your courage has proven you worthy to follow the path of the dwarves. Take the blade and walk the path of the sword.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4881 = ~You have answered all the questions correctly and are a true friend of Korolnor. Take the blade and walk the path of the sword.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4882 = ~Suddenly, one of the weathered dwarven statues seems to come to life. There is a loud hiss as an ancient mechanism stirs within the statue, set in motion by the long-departed dwarves. The statue raises its voice in a monotone, reciting a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4883 = ~"He who takes the gems of the Jewel Kingdom must prove himself worthy of them. Are you prepared to face the question of Korolnor?"~
@4884 = ~It seems the same builders who worked on Durlag’s Tower were at work here.~
@4885 = ~Yes.~
@4886 = ~No.~

@4887 = ~Couldn’t I just put the gemstone back?~
@4888 = ~The statue does not respond. It seems to only react to specific command words.~
@4889 = ~I’m certainly not answering questions from a metal automaton.~
@4890 = ~Very well, ask your question, statue.~
@4891 = ~What would you do if I simply walked away?~
@4892 = ~"I do not understand you and will ask one final time: He who takes the gems of the Jewel Kingdom must prove himself worthy. Are you ready to face Korolnor’s question?"~
@4893 = ~"Then you shall die the death of a thief!"~
@4894 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. Tell me: To which kingdom does Korolnor belong?"~
@4895 = ~Tethyr.~
@4896 = ~Amn.~
@4897 = ~Calimshan.~
@4898 = ~Shanatar.~
@4899 = ~Delzoun.~
@4900 = ~Mithral Hall.~
@4901 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! Feel the wrath of Shanatar!"~
@4902 = ~"Your answer is accepted. Go forth and walk with the blessing of Shanatar, friend of dwarves."~
@4903 = ~Once again, one of the weathered dwarven statues surrounding this chamber comes to life. The statue raises its voice in a monotone and begins a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4904 = ~*Sigh* I suppose I don’t really have a choice in this, do I?~
@4905 = ~"I do not understand you and will ask you one final time: He who takes the gems of the Jewel Kingdom must prove himself worthy. Are you ready to face Korolnor’s question?"~
@4906 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. Tell me: Who was the founder and clan father of this place?"~
@4907 = ~Taark Shanat.~
@4908 = ~Karlyn Kuldelver.~
@4909 = ~Durlag Trollkiller.~
@4910 = ~Bruenor Battlehammer.~
@4911 = ~Korgan Bloodaxe.~
@4912 = ~Dwarf Nose.~
@4913 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! Die the same death as Karlyn’s enemies—by a dwarf’s weapon!"~
@4914 = ~"Your answer is accepted. Go forth and walk with the approval of Karlyn Kuldelver, friend of dwarves."~
@4915 = ~Are all dwarves really this uncreative with their riddles?~
@4916 = ~How about I ask *you* a question instead?~
@4917 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. Taark Shanat founded the first dwarven kingdom of Shanatar and named his realm Alatorin. Tell me: How many sub-kingdoms did the dwarves of Shanatar establish besides Alatorin?"~
@4918 = ~Seven.~
@4919 = ~Five.~
@4920 = ~Six.~
@4921 = ~Twelve.~
@4922 = ~Three.~
@4923 = ~Nine.~
@4924 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! You shall die by nine blades, for Shanatar flourished with nine kingdoms!"~
@4925 = ~"Your answer is correct. Go forth and discover the nine sub-kingdoms of Shanatar, friend of dwarves."~
@4926 = ~For the fourth time, one of the weathered dwarven statues surrounding this chamber comes to life. The statue once again begins a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4927 = ~Do I really have to go through this until I’ve collected all the gems?~
@4928 = ~No wonder Shanatar fell if the dwarves wasted all their energy on dull riddles like this.~
@4929 = ~"Cursed shall you be, just as the outcast Child of Moradin was cursed!"~
@4930 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. The dwarves once revered one of the Outcast as their patron. Tell me, where did the Outcast come from?"~
@4931 = ~He was a mind flayer.~
@4932 = ~He was a duergar.~
@4933 = ~He was a demon of the Abyss.~
@4934 = ~He was a human.~
@4935 = ~He was one of Moradin’s children.~
@4936 = ~He was the son of Deep Duerra.~
@4937 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! Cursed shall you be, just as the outcast Child of Moradin was cursed!"~
@4938 = ~"Your answer is correct. May the betrayal of one of Moradin’s own always serve as a warning to you."~
@4939 = ~For the fifth time, one of the weathered dwarven statues surrounding this chamber comes to life. The statue once again begins a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4940 = ~I’m actually starting to like you, statue.~
@4941 = ~What do you even do when you’re not asking riddles?~
@4942 = ~"Perish by the will of Clangeddin, the new patron of Korolnor!"~
@4943 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. What did the dwarves do when their patron was cast out of the Morndinsamman?"~
@4944 = ~They chose Clangeddin as a new patron from the dwarven pantheon.~
@4945 = ~They abandoned their faith.~
@4946 = ~They began worshipping a demon lord.~
@4947 = ~They worshipped a human god instead.~
@4948 = ~They worshipped Ao.~
@4949 = ~They worshipped Bhaal.~
@4950 = ~"Your answer is heresy! No dwarf would ever worship any but the Morndinsamman! Perish by the will of Clangeddin, the new patron of Korolnor!"~
@4951 = ~"Your answer is correct. Walk with the blessing of Clangeddin Silverbeard, the valiant protector of Korolnor."~
@4952 = ~For the sixth time, one of the weathered dwarven statues surrounding this chamber comes to life. The statue once again begins a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4953 = ~Alright, the second-to-last riddle. Let’s get this over with.~
@4954 = ~"Then fight, as Karlyn once fought against the giants!"~
@4955 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. Karlyn Kuldelver built this place to honor his greatest victory. Against whom was this victory won?"~
@4956 = ~Humans.~
@4957 = ~Dark elves.~
@4958 = ~Duergar.~
@4959 = ~Giants.~
@4960 = ~Trolls.~
@4961 = ~Goblins.~
@4962 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! Karlyn drove an entire army of giants westward! Fight, as Karlyn once fought against the giants!"~
@4963 = ~"Your answer is correct. Praise the deeds of Karlyn Giantbane with every giant you slay."~
@4964 = ~For the seventh time, one of the weathered dwarven statues surrounding this chamber comes to life. The statue once again begins a brief monologue.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@4965 = ~"He who takes the gems of the dwarves must prove himself worthy. Are you ready to face Korolnor’s question?"~
@4966 = ~Well, there are no gems left now. Are you running out of questions?~
@4967 = ~"I do not understand you and will ask you one final time: He who takes the gems of the dwarves must prove himself worthy. Are you ready to face Korolnor’s question?"~
@4968 = ~"Then fight against the unyielding gems of the Jewel Kingdom!"~
@4969 = ~"This is Korolnor, home of Clan Kuldelver. In the old assembly hall before the sealed temple, every envoy must offer a tribute from their kingdom to gain access to the Throne of the Mad God. Which tribute do you choose for Korolnor?"~
@4970 = ~Gold.~
@4971 = ~Silver.~
@4972 = ~Steel.~
@4973 = ~Jewels.~
@4974 = ~Copper.~
@4975 = ~Bronze.~
@4976 = ~"Your answer is incorrect! Jewels and gems are Korolnor’s greatest treasure! Perish by their unyielding hand!"~
@4977 = ~"Your answer is correct. Whenever you find a gemstone, remember the glorious days of Korolnor."~
