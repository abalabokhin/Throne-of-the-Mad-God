@5250 = ~Haha! Little runts are bold, just barging in on King Madugg! Just waltzing in and opening doors. I should punish my guards outside for letting you in…~ [AC#MGFG1]
@5251 = ~I've already taken care of that for you.~
@5252 = ~You're a king?~
@5253 = ~Die, you fat monster!~
@5254 = ~Fine. You speak quickly, for King Madugg is not known for patience with little runts.~
@5255 = ~Who says I have much patience for you?~
@5256 = ~You call yourself a king?~
@5257 = ~I'm looking for an adventuring party led by a man named Bryam Lancameth.~
@5258 = ~This will be quick. I plan to make short work of you!~
@5259 = ~Not *a* king. Madugg THE king. Madugg is the strongest, fattest, and smartest of the fomorians, so Madugg is king!~
@5260 = ~I am delighted to make the acquaintance of such a... uh... unique being, King Madugg.~
@5261 = ~Your reign ends here.~
@5262 = ~Finally, someone who understands. What do you want, runts?~
@5263 = ~Let me pass, and I will spare you.~
@5264 = ~I want to kill you.~
@5265 = ~Hahaha! What do you think you are, runt?~
@5266 = ~Oh, it’s you! The voice in the pipe announced you. *Karontor* announced you. If Madugg kills you, Karontor will be even happier with Madugg! So hold still, yes?~
@5267 = ~King Madugg understands. You want a fight? A fight is good! Good for Madugg. Not for you. Stupid little runts!~
@5268 = ~Madugg will trample and crush you!~
@5269 = ~The gates to the Temple of the Guardian stand open to you. The throne room remains sealed and may not be entered!~ [AC#MGSS1]
@5270 = ~Those who wish to enter the sealed halls must prove their allegiance! A token of their respective kingdom must be placed in the correct spot.~ [AC#MGSS1]
@5271 = ~Just as Iltkazar offers its noble mithral or Korolnor its most precious jewels, so too must each sub-kingdom offer its treasure. The correct tokens open the gates, and the path to the Guardian’s temple will be revealed.~
@5272 = ~The stone tablets are countless, their carvings as vast as the roots of the mountains. Where does understanding begin, and where does it end? So many secrets etched into the eternal stone of ages...~
@5273 = ~And yet, the answers we seek often lie hidden behind thick walls that we believe we can penetrate. Will the knowledge of my soul find peace, or will it forever be lost in the depths of these halls?~
@5274 = ~Do you belong to Lancameth’s party?~
@5275 = ~Who are you?~
@5276 = ~I’ll come back later. You’ll surely be here for a while.~
@5277 = ~Once... once, I ventured forth with Bryam Lancameth and other brave souls, guided by the pursuit of hidden knowledge and the mysteries of this world. But our paths led us to depths from which we could not escape. Now, I linger in these halls as a shadow of what once was, bound to the secrets we sought to uncover.~
@5278 = ~What happened? Why did you become a ghost?~
@5279 = ~I will return later.~
@5280 = ~Our journey was driven by courage and the hunger for knowledge, but it led us deeper into darkness than we had ever imagined.~
@5281 = ~We sought the heart of the Wailing Dwarf, that ancient structure surrounded by mysteries of old powers. But what we found was not just hidden knowledge, but also an ancient curse, woven from betrayal and boundless wrath. This curse tied our souls to this mortal world, trapped between life and death.~
@5282 = ~Now we are guardians of the secrets we once sought to unveil, forever bound to keep the ruins hidden from the eyes of the world—until, mayhap, one day, a release is granted to us.~
@5283 = ~How can we free you?~
@5284 = ~Our fate was sealed by the betrayal of one of our own, who chose darkness over light and bound us here in the shadow of eternal watch. The traitor still walks among the shadows, surrounded by guilt and darkness. Only when his betrayal is atoned for—when justice balances the wrongs done—can our souls find peace.~
@5285 = ~Find the traitor, uncover the truth behind his treachery, and bring him to justice. Only then will the spell be broken that binds our souls to this place. Only then can we truly rest.~
@5286 = ~Then I will seek out this traitor.~
@5287 = ~The path of knowledge is endless and twisted, like the corridors of these caves.~
@5288 = ~Go with the blessing of the Lord of All Knowledge, for Oghma guides all our steps.~
@5289 = ~KARONTOR speaks to you, unworthy one! Who are you? Reveal yourself!~ [AC#MGSIR]
@5290 = ~Don’t worry about me. I’m already leaving.~
@5291 = ~You are the god the fomorian giants worship here?~
@5292 = ~I Stompface, fomorian giant. Walk around, look for stuff. What do next?~
@5293 = ~You again? A floor up, you were the god of the trolls…~
@5294 = ~I am no unworthy one, but a champion of truth and challenger of false gods. Show yourself!~
@5295 = ~Stompface, listen up. Go catch another slave. Don’t eat him! Lay him at the sealed door and wait for further orders. Prove that you can follow commands.~
@5296 = ~Where door?~

@5297 = ~That’s all I need to know, voice. I will wait for you at the door.~
@5298 = ~You’re no giant!~
@5299 = ~The door to the lower floor! The one my... little servants always use!~
@5300 = ~What servants?~
@5301 = ~Very well! I will wait for you at the door!~
@5302 = ~Who are you? Answer me at once!~
@5303 = ~You again? What do you want?~
@5304 = ~I want to know what’s going on here.~
@5305 = ~I am looking for Bryam Lancameth.~
@5306 = ~If you were truly a god, you’d surely have no trouble figuring that out for yourself, would you?~
@5307 = ~Yes! I am... Karontor, god of the giants and all other outcasts!~
@5308 = ~Interesting... first the trolls, now the giants...~
@5309 = ~Kneel and tremble before my limitless power!~
@5310 = ~Absolutely not!~
@5311 = ~More likely before your rancid breath wafting up through the pipe.~
@5312 = ~Why should I do that? I’m no giant.~
@5313 = ~No... giant? You... you dare to call upon my name when... you are not one of the faithful? Who or what are you?~
@5314 = ~Rraagh! You make me angry!~
@5315 = ~We will find you soon enough, wretched creature!~
@5316 = ~You have returned! The cheese was absolutely delicious!~ [amb_e45a]
@5317 = ~And now, your part of the bargain.~
@5318 = ~I’ll be on my way, then.~
@5319 = ~Hadn’t we already helped you? No matter.~
@5320 = ~Well? Have you changed your mind and decided to hear what we have to offer?~ [amb_e45a]
@5321 = ~Yes.~
@5322 = ~No.~
@5323 = ~You have returned! Do you have the cheese?~ [amb_e45a]
@5324 = ~Yes, here it is.~
@5325 = ~Oh! With all your stench of sweat and blood, the cheese was almost drowned out!~
@5326 = ~Do you smell it, brothers and sisters? This will be a feast!~
@5327 = ~Very well. What do you want to know?~
@5328 = ~What can you tell me?~
@5329 = ~Tell me about the giants.~
@5330 = ~Tell me about the dwarves who built this place.~
@5331 = ~I’m looking for an adventuring party. Their leader was named Bryam Lancameth.~
@5332 = ~Tell me about yourselves.~
@5333 = ~Can you help me fight the giants?~
@5334 = ~Send out the rats now, please.~
@5335 = ~I have no more questions. Farewell.~
@5336 = ~Quite a lot! About the inhabitants of this place, a little about its history... we have an excellent collective memory!~
@5337 = ~I’d like to ask something else.~
@5338 = ~That’s all. Farewell.~
@5339 = ~Yes, we know them. Four went down. They mourned a fallen one they had to leave behind above. A little mage led them, though this Lancameth seemed to be the head of the group. Four went down, none came back.~
@5340 = ~What could have happened to them?~
@5341 = ~We don’t know. Strange, though—when they passed, not a single giant or troll was around. But afterward? They were everywhere again. Almost like the adventurers were meant to get through...~
@5342 = ~Why?~


@5343 = ~Mayhap to set a trap for them? We cannot tell you more.~
@5344 = ~Oh, the dwarves. The first rats of our family were already here when the dwarves inhabited this place. The illithids sent us as spies. When the dwarves were gone, the mind flayers forgot about us. The dwarven kingdom was mighty! Many jewels, plenty to eat. But eventually, fate turned against them.~
@5345 = ~What happened?~
@5346 = ~The god of the dwarves turned evil, our ancestors said mad. Dark creatures emerged from his once-glorious temple, and the dwarves could only survive by choosing another god and imprisoning the old one somewhere deep within his temple. The old god did not like that, and he sent wicked, winged creatures after the dwarves.~
@5347 = ~Go on.~
@5348 = ~In our collective memory, we can still hear the screams of the dwarves. Many dwarves were bitten, many headless bodies fell to the ground. Eventually, the screams fell silent, and there were no more dwarves. The winged creatures withdrew to the lowest depths.~
@5349 = ~What kind of creatures were they?~
@5350 = ~We do not know. They flew, we could not see them. But they had a bone-chilling scream that doomed many dwarves.~
@5351 = ~They have large, thick feet that stink. And they mostly limp. They seem rather clumsy. Their leader is called Madugg. He is even bigger than them—and a bit smarter. His thoughts constantly circle around his god Karontor, who speaks to him, and about how he sees himself as a king.~
@5352 = ~You can read his thoughts?~
@5353 = ~Who could this Karontor be?~
@5354 = ~Oh yes, that’s not difficult. Besides, he constantly talks to himself whenever he mentions Karontor.~
@5355 = ~Karontor appears to be a god of the giants who speaks to Madugg. He sees himself as the chosen one and lets this Karontor order him around. And Madugg, in turn, orders his giants around. Madugg believes he grows stronger through Karontor. That is what his thoughts revolve around.~
@5356 = ~Can you tell me anything else about the giants?~
@5357 = ~No, we do not know more.~
@5358 = ~We are a colony of very special rats. Once, our ancestors were sent by the mind flayers to spy on the dwarven community. The dwarves have been gone for a long time, the illithids forgot about us, and now we live our own humble lives in the midst of our swarm, trying not to get trampled by giants or eaten by giant cats or trolls.~
@5359 = ~If any are still alive, sure! We will send some lesser rats to pester them, keep them busy. But you’ll have to do the killing yourselves!~
@5360 = ~Good. Send out the rats.~
@5361 = ~I've already taken care of the giants.~
@5362 = ~Hold off on that for now.~
@5363 = ~You must be strong to have faced them.~
@5364 = ~Are there more giants? Who is their leader?~
@5365 = ~A wise decision. Once the stupid rats are unleashed, there’s no going back!~
@5366 = ~They’re on their way! You’d better hurry; the normal rats won’t last long!~
@5367 = ~We will watch your progress from a safe distance, <RACE>.~
@5368 = ~Then keep looking!~
@5369 = ~Hey! Squeak! Over here!~ [amb_e45a]
@5370 = ~What? Where?~
@5371 = ~Who’s there?~
@5372 = ~A monster!~
@5373 = ~So, have you changed your mind and decided to bring us the cheese?~ [amb_e45a]
@5374 = ~Down here, in the mouse hole!~
@5375 = ~You’re talking mice?~
@5376 = ~Who’s hiding there?~
@5377 = ~We are rats. Very clever rats!~
@5378 = ~So that’s why you can talk?~
@5379 = ~No. We are not mice—we are... rats. A special kind of rats.~
@5380 = ~And you talk?~
@5381 = ~If there are many of us, yes.~
@5382 = ~How many of you are there?~
@5383 = ~What do you want from me?~
@5384 = ~Oh, we are many. Very many! But that’s not your concern.~
@5385 = ~We’d like to make you an offer. One paw washes the other, understand?~
@5386 = ~Yes, I think I understand.~
@5387 = ~Then let’s hear your proposal.~
@5388 = ~Not interested.~
@5389 = ~Alright, listen up. In the next big room, there’s a huge piece of cheese. Delicious cheese! Unfortunately, we can’t reach it because it’s on a table. You get us the cheese, and we’ll help you.~
@5390 = ~That doesn’t sound too difficult.~
@5391 = ~Why should I do that?~
@5392 = ~Because we could help you in return. And it’s not hard! You just have to get past the giants who call this part of the dwarven ruins their home.~
@5393 = ~There are giants here? What kind of giants?~
@5394 = ~I’m supposed to risk my life fighting giants for a piece of cheese?~
@5395 = ~And what do I get in return?~
@5396 = ~Forget it.~
@5397 = ~That’s what we thought! You just have to get past the giants who call this part of the dwarven ruins their home.~
@5398 = ~Giants? What kind of giants?~
@5399 = ~A few giants won’t stop me from bringing you a cheese.~
@5400 = ~A good attitude.~
@5401 = ~From the way you look, you’d have to pass them anyway if you want to delve deeper into the dwarven city.~
@5402 = ~What kind of giants live here?~
@5403 = ~Well, big, *giant* giants! To us rats, they all look the same because we mostly only see their feet. But they make delicious cheese! We want it. You must bring it to us.~
@5404 = ~You don’t have to bring us the whole cheese wheel. Just a small piece!~
@5405 = ~Deal.~
@5406 = ~I still say you should get it yourselves.~
@5407 = ~We can help you! We observe a lot in this place, from the shadows. You seem to be looking for something. Gold? Gems? Doesn’t matter. You bring us the cheese, we tell you stories.~
@5408 = ~I’m looking for a lost adventuring party.~
@5409 = ~That’s irrelevant for now. Cheese first!~
@5410 = ~Oh, and if you manage to get our cheese quietly, without making a mess, we will help you take care of the giants.~
@5411 = ~You want to help us fight the giants?~
@5412 = ~I think you might be overestimating yourselves a little.~
@5413 = ~What do you mean by quietly?~
@5414 = ~No, we won’t help you. At least not directly. We’re too refined for that. But we can dominate ordinary rats and send them to harass the giants. That should distract them, which could be useful for you in battle.~
@5415 = ~I need to assess the situation myself before I agree to your plan.~
@5416 = ~Sounds good. I’ll bring you the cheese, and you help me get rid of the giants.~
@5417 = ~Distract the giants. Make some noise, you’ll find something. Lure them away from our cheese. Snatch the cheese without them noticing!~
@5418 = ~Sounds like a good plan.~
@5419 = ~Quietly, stealthily, cheesily.~
@5420 = ~Do that! Just don’t forget the cheese on your way back! No cheese, no deal.~
@5421 = ~You know where to find us. Happy cheese hunting, <RACE>.~
@5422 = ~As you wish. We’ll be here for a while. You know where to find us if you change your mind, <RACE>.~
@5423 = ~Suit yourself. Then we won’t help you either!~
@5424 = ~As you wish, cheesebringer.~
@5425 = ~You speak our language well, <RACE>!~
@5426 = ~Of course, it’s a good plan. After all, it’s ours!~
@5427 = ~Now get going before some stray cat notices us. Return with the cheese, then we’ll talk further.~
@5428 = ~A cheese in exchange for a giant? Boo is eager to track down this... cheese! Maybe he’ll get a piece too?~
@5429 = ~How much lower will you sink, <CHARNAME>? Now we’re making deals with rats?~
@5430 = ~A good decision. Rats can get into places no larger creature could.~

@5431 = ~Additionally, feel free to keep an eye out for books and trade them with us.~
@5432 = ~You read books?~
@5433 = ~Of course we do! A good cheese feast makes one thirsty for knowledge. Old books, stories, histories—we love them! So keep an eye out for those as well. It wouldn’t hurt if you read them yourself first, but afterward, you can hand them over to us.~
@5434 = ~We come across all sorts of trinkets here, which we could trade in return. But first—cheese! Cheese first, books later! So you'd best get searching.~
@5435 = ~How do I get to the next level?~  
@5436 = ~You wish to descend to the lower level? Access is granted only to those who correctly place the Gifts of Shanatar and present themselves as representatives of their kingdoms.~ 
@5437 = ~Bring us fine books! We'll give you gold in return, since you big folks seem to care so much about it!~  
@5438 = ~I’d like to trade a few things with you.~
