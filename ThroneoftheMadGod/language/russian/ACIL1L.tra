@4600 = ~I... cannot... die... I rise again and again... the betrayal binds me to this world...~
@4601 = ~Blasphemy! You dare defile the sanctity of the fallen? To desecrate my corpse?~
@4602 = ~Who are you?~
@4603 = ~Forgive me, but I believe you have something I need to continue my quest.~
@4604 = ~You're already dead. You don't need your stuff anymore, do you?~
@4605 = ~Exactly. I spit on your corpse, and I’ll send your spirit straight to the Fugue Plane!~
@4606 = ~Who am I? In life, they called me Starthorn... Starthorn the Elf. But I live no longer and walk as a restless spirit. So let my body rest and do not defile it further!~
@4607 = ~Starthorn? You were part of Bryam Lancameth’s party, weren’t you?~
@4608 = ~Then it will be my pleasure to grant you eternal rest by destroying you!~
@4609 = ~Lancameth... a name like a fleeting whisper in old memories. Once, I traveled with him... we stepped into the darkness while I still belonged to the world of the living... I could tell you more, but first, you must let what remains of my body rest in peace!~
@4610 = ~Leave me be! You stir the unrest that my soul should have long abandoned! Explain yourselves—why should I allow you to pillage my corpse?~
@4611 = ~A clear explanation of our intentions might help ease the tension.~
@4612 = ~Show truth and sincerity, <CHARNAME>, to quell her mistrust and calm her anger.~
@4613 = ~I’m not sure negotiating with an undead spirit is the best course. Better to grant her soul eternal rest by destroying her.~
@4614 = ~We are the living, and we do what is necessary. The rest of a spirit is worth less than our own goals.~
@4615 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, speak gently to her! Perhaps you can show her we are not here to disturb, but to help.~
@4616 = ~Bah! Ghosts and their eternal whining! We’re here to take what we need, and no spectral elf will stop us!~
@4617 = ~We could grant you eternal rest if we could uncover the betrayal of your party. I need every clue I can find—including your former belongings.~
@4618 = ~We seek means to prevent greater disaster. Without what you carried in life, we may not succeed.~
@4619 = ~I do not bargain with the undead!~
@4620 = ~I will end your undead existence here and now!~
@4621 = ~The silence of these endless halls should be eternal... yet you have roused me, torn the veil of my death!~
@4622 = ~A living soul... in these crumbling halls? Only shadows have been my constant companions—a memory trapped in the void. What brings you into this darkness, to the ones forgotten by death?~
@4623 = ~We seek knowledge and understanding of what transpired here. Can you help us understand the past?~
@4624 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@4625 = ~I will put an end to your undead existence.~
@4626 = ~I must go.~
@4627 = ~Who am I? In life, they called me Starthorn... Starthorn the Elf. But I live no longer and walk as a restless spirit.~
@4628 = ~Starthorn? You were part of Bryam Lancameth’s party!~
@4629 = ~Another ghost! I’ll deal with you as well.~
@4630 = ~You return, living one. What brings you into this darkness, to the ones forgotten by death?~
@4631 = ~You were part of Bryam Lancameth’s party, weren’t you?~
@4632 = ~Lancameth... a name like a fleeting whisper in old memories. Once, I traveled with him... we stepped into the darkness while I still belonged to the world of the living...~
@4633 = ~We have heard of your fate and that of your companions. What can you tell us about the events that brought you here?~
@4634 = ~That is all. Now, I will end your undead existence!~
@4635 = ~That is all. I will return later.~
@4636 = ~Our mission... oh, how long has it been! We sought to grasp the darkness, to bind it to us. But it was the darkness within ourselves that led to our doom. One among us, consumed by madness, tore the void open and revealed the betrayal.~
@4637 = ~Who betrayed you?~
@4638 = ~Here, deep beneath the earth, the dwarves hammered their lives into stone and ore. They called this place Korolnor. A realm of splendor and riches. But for my kind, who walk beneath the stars, it is nothing but a tomb. My tomb! Cold and empty, like the hearts of those who once lived here.~
@4639 = ~Were you also part of Bryam Lancameth’s party?~
@4640 = ~The traitor... a being without a soul, a name I have forgotten. He was among us... a sickness without a face, a twisted image of madness... The ancient seal on the locked gate revealed his true nature. You will find him there... or rather, he will be waiting for you... just as he waited for us... Now I wait here, trapped between worlds, until the traitor meets his fate and I am finally freed.~
@4641 = ~How can we free you?~
@4642 = ~Then wait a little longer until I return.~
@4643 = ~Freedom... a distant, faded word. I am bound, shackled to the shadows of these halls... Only when the traitor himself falls will the last thread that binds my soul to this place be severed. As long as his bad heart beats, I wander... a shadow among shadows. Find him... and grant me the release I long for.~
@4644 = ~We will find this traitor and grant you peace.~
@4645 = ~I am not sure I am willing to take such a risk.~
@4646 = ~If I bring down this traitor, it won’t be for your peace—it will be for my own gain.~
@4647 = ~Ghosts belong in the afterlife. It is time to finally free you by destroying you!~
@4648 = ~I will return later.~
@4649 = ~So be it.~
@4650 = ~Tread through the darkness, but be wary in these halls.~
@4651 = ~You would attack me? How foolish!~
@4652 = ~Your words carry weight, and I sense truth in them. The burden of centuries and solitude has clouded my sense of justice. Very well, take what you need, if it might bring some meaning to ending my restlessness. I will not stop you.~
@4653 = ~Feel the despair of one trapped between worlds! Hear my lament and despair!~
